    Dear {{ confidant_user.name|default:"Friend" }},

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    <strong>{{ user.name }}</strong> has used their private emergency PIN (also known as <em>Destructive PIN</em>) on TownLIT. This feature is designed for times when someone might be facing serious distress or danger.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    As someone they trust and have listed as a confidant, you’re receiving this alert because your presence may make a difference.

    This doesn't always mean something is wrong — but it could. A kind check-in, a message, or even a prayer may be exactly what they need right now.

  <h3 style="color: #F4A429;">What Can I Do?</h3>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; color: #2B2C30; font-size: 15px;">
    <li>Sometimes a quiet prayer or your silent presence in their life can be powerful.</li>
    <li>Reach out to others who may be close to them and check in gently through trusted connections.</li>
    <li>Avoid direct contact if you suspect it could put either of you at risk — safety comes first.</li>
    <li>If you’re seriously concerned, you have the option to temporarily limit access to their profile through your TownLIT settings as a protective measure.</li>
    <li>Consider seeking wisdom or support from a trusted spiritual leader or counselor who can help guide next steps.</li>
  </ul>

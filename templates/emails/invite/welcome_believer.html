  <p>
    Hello <strong>{{ user.username|default:'Friend' }}</strong>,
  </p> <br>

  <p>
    Your account has been successfully created, and you’ve just taken your first real step into TownLIT.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started, you may want to complete your profile, choose an avatar that represents you, and take a moment to explore the community. There’s no pressure to do everything at once — TownLIT is designed to meet you where you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the best experience (until the native iOS and Android apps are available), we recommend adding TownLIT to your home screen so it feels like a real app on your phone.
  </p>

  <p>
    <div class="title-paraf">On iPhone (Safari):</div><br />
    <div>→ Open TownLIT in Safari</div>
    <div>→ tap the <strong>Share</strong> icon (square with an arrow)</div>
    <div>→ scroll down and select <strong>Add to Home Screen</strong>.</div>     
  </p>

  <p>
    <div class="title-paraf">On Android (Chrome):</div><br />
    <div>→ Open TownLIT</div>
    <div>→ tap <strong>Install TownLIT App</strong> (or the install prompt)</div>
    <div>→ tap <strong>Install</strong>.</div>
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    We are ready to welcome people into something built with heart — a place created with care, faith, and genuine love for community. We’re grateful that you are part of this beginning.
  </p>

  <p class="email-signature">
    With warmth and hope,<br />
    The TownLIT Team

  <p>
    Dear <strong>{{ first_name|default:'Friend' }}</strong>,
  </p>

  <p>We’ve been waiting for this moment — and so have you. Your faithful patience has not gone unnoticed, and today, with open arms and a grateful heart, we welcome you to TownLIT.</p>

  <p>TownLIT isn’t just a platform — it’s a living city, rooted in the presence of the Lord. A sacred digital space where believers, seekers, and Kingdom builders gather to reflect His light and truth.</p>

  <p>As someone who waited, hoped, and prayed with us from the beginning, this invitation is more than a link — it’s a shared step forward in faith.</p>

    “You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.”<br />
    <span style="font-size: 14px;">– Matthew 5:14</span>
  </p>

  <p>TownLIT was built through prayer, in seasons of solitude and faith — not with abundance, but with conviction. Today, it begins to open — slowly, intentionally — and you are part of its foundation.</p>

  <p class="email-signature">
    In love and hope,<br />
    TownLIT

  <p>
    Hi <strong>{{ first_name|default:'Friend' }}</strong>,
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Some spaces begin with noise.<br>
    TownLIT began with prayer, patience, and a quiet hope — the kind that grows slowly, shaped by people rather than systems, and by presence rather than speed.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s becoming a living place where faith, reflection, and genuine connection meet, and where each person who enters helps shape what this city is becoming.
  </p>

  <p>
    We simply wanted to let you know that you’re warmly welcome to join and become part of this growing journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    If and when you’re ready, you can use your personal invitation code below:
  </p>

  <div class="email-code-container">
    <div class="text-code-box">YOUR PERSONAL INVITATION CODE</div>
    <div class="code-box">{{ invitation_code }}</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Your invitation code is still active. By clicking the link below, you can enter the registration page and complete a quick sign-up — it takes less than 30 seconds to join the TownLIT family.
  </p>

  <div class="email-button-container">
    <a href="{{ signup_link }}" class="email-button">Enter TownLIT</a>
  </div>

  <p class="email-reflection">
    “Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.”<br />

  </p>

  <p>
    We’d be honored to have you with us as TownLIT continues to grow and take shape. The platform is being actively developed, with new and unique features being added regularly, and you’ll be notified as each new section becomes available.
  </p>

    With warmth and peace,<br />

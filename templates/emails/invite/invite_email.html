    🎄 Merry Christmas <strong>{{ first_name|default:'Friend' }}</strong>,
  </p> <br>
  
  <p>
    Today is a meaningful day for all of us — a celebration of Christ’s birth, and the moment TownLIT begins to open its doors for the first time.
  </p>


  <p>
    TownLIT was shaped slowly, through prayer, care, and a shared desire to create a space that feels alive and purposeful. It is not just a digital platform, but a growing city — one formed by people who believe in light, truth, and walking together in faith.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are among the first invited to enter this space. Your invitation represents more than early access; it reflects trust, shared hope, and a place in the foundation of what is being built. TownLIT will take shape through the presence of its people, and every presence matters.

    “You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.”<br />
    <span style="font-size: 14px;">– Matthew 5:14</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    As TownLIT opens on this Christmas Day, we do so with intention and humility. We are ready to welcome people into something built with heart — a place created not in haste, but with care, faith, and genuine love for community.

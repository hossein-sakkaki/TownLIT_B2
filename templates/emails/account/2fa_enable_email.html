<h1>Verify Your Identity</h1>

<p>Hey {{ user.name|default:"there" }},</p>

<p>To complete the activation of two-factor authentication (2FA) on your TownLIT account, please enter the following verification code:</p>

<div class="email-button-container">
  <div class="code-box">{{ otp_code }}</div>
</div>

<p>This code is valid for <strong>{{ expiration_minutes }}</strong> minutes. Enter it in the app or website to confirm and enable 2FA.</p>

<p>If you did not request this, you can ignore this message — no changes will be made to your account.</p>

<p class="email-reflection">
  We believe that spiritual communities deserve real-world security. Two-factor authentication is a small step to help protect what truly matters — your presence and peace in TownLIT.
</p>

<p class="email-signature">With care,<br />TownLIT</p>

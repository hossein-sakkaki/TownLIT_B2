<h1>Complete Your Login</h1>

<p>Hey {{ user.name|default:"there" }},</p>

<p>You're trying to sign in to your TownLIT account from a protected device or location. To help keep your account safe, please enter the verification code below to complete your login:</p>

<div class="email-button-container">
  <div class="code-box">{{ otp_code }}</div>
</div>

<p>This code will expire in {{ expiration_minutes }} minutes. If you don’t complete the login within this time, you’ll need to request a new code.</p>

<p>If this login attempt wasn’t made by you, your account is still safe. We recommend changing your password just in case and reviewing your login history in your profile settings.</p>

<p class="email-reflection">
  Every step you take matters — and we walk with you. Security isn’t just protection; it’s partnership.
</p>

<p class="email-signature">With care,<br />TownLIT</p>

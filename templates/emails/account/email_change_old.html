<h1>Did You Request to Change Your Email?</h1>

<p>Hey {{ user.name|default:"there" }},</p>

<p>We’ve received a request to change the email address associated with your TownLIT account. To confirm that it was really you, please use the code below:</p>

<div class="email-button-container">
  <div class="code-box">{{ code }}</div>
</div>

<p>This code is valid for {{ expiration_minutes }} minutes. Enter it in the app or on the website to proceed with the change.</p>

<p>If you did not request this, your account is still secure — and no changes will be made.</p>

<p class="email-reflection">
  Protecting your presence in this community is sacred to us. Your trust matters deeply.
</p>

<p class="email-signature">With care,<br />TownLIT</p>
